# Project Euler Go projects

There are just some of the projects I've finished from project euler. For those who don't know, project euler is basically a set of math problems that are most simply solved using a brute force method, which can only practically be implemented using code. In these examples, I've been using Go lang since I'm trying to learn it. There aren't guaranteed to be solved properly, just that they compile properly.
